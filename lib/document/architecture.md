# Architecture

## Overview

The application follows a clean architecture pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability. The primary components of the architecture are:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Handles the UI and user interaction. Uses Flutter widgets and GetX for state management.
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic and domain entities. It defines the use cases and interacts with the repository.
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data sources and repositories. Handles data fetching, caching, and transformation.
4. **External Dependencies**: Includes services like authentication, APIs, and local storage.

## Layer Responsibilities

  - Entities representing business objects.
  - Use cases defining the application's core logic.

### Data Layer
- **Features**:
  - Repositories interacting with data sources.
  - Local data sources (e.g., local database).
