# Design Decisions

## State Management

**Decision**: Use GetX for state management.

**Reasoning**: GetX provides a simple and efficient way to manage state and dependencies in Flutter applications. It offers reactive state management, dependency injection, and route management in a single package.

## Architecture

**Decision**: Implement clean architecture.

**Reasoning**: Clean architecture promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable. By separating the presentation, domain, and data layers, we ensure that changes in one layer do not affect others.

## API Communication

**Decision**: Use Dio for HTTP requests.

**Reasoning**: Dio is a powerful and flexible HTTP client for Dart. It supports interceptors, global configuration, and error handling, making it suitable for complex API interactions.

## Authentication

**Decision**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

**Reasoning**: JWT provides a stateless authentication mechanism that is scalable and secure. It allows the server to verify the authenticity of requests without needing to store session data.

## Local Storage

**Decision**: Use Hive for local storage.

**Reasoning**: Hive is a lightweight and fast key-value database that is easy to use with Flutter. It supports complex data types and provides efficient storage and retrieval operations.

## Dependency Injection

**Decision**: Use GetIt for dependency injection.

**Reasoning**: GetIt is a simple service locator for Dart that helps manage dependencies and promotes loose coupling. It integrates well with GetX and simplifies dependency management.

## Routing

**Decision**: Use GetX for routing and navigation.

**Reasoning**: GetX offers a straightforward approach to routing and navigation with a minimal amount of boilerplate code. It supports named routes and dynamic route parameters.
